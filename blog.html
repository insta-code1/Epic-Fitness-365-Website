					<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>

				<p>Have you started wondering whether you should join a gym? There are many ways you can go about starting a gym routine but the key to creating the ‘perfect gym routine,’ mainly comes from, what works best for you at the gym. <br></br>Creating a gym atmosphere that you enjoy and a routine can be difficult especially, if you don't quite know what your goals are and that's going to be the first step in figuring out how to build the perfect gym routine.
				<br></br>
				<b>Understanding Your Situation & Planning Ahead</b>
				<br></br>Take a look at your station and life and try to plan accordingly. Do you have a busy schedule? And maybe even a family. Well, that’s okay. Everybody has commitments and when your attempting to build the best workout routine it’s always important to take those commitments into consideration, that way you can better plan around them and create routine that will show results for your life. <br></br>
				The very first thing to understand here is that you don’t need to spend a full 2 hours at the gym to see results, in fact you only need a good 30 minute workout and you’ll be sure to see results, as long as you plan accordingly
				<br></br>
				<b>How Should I Start My Routine? </b>
				<br></br>
				Alright, unless you’ve been going to the gym for years and you have a lot endurance, take it easy. It’s important to remember that when starting a new gym routine you’ll want to start at your pace and adjust your exercises to what works for you, if there’s pain, stop and reevaluate your position. 
				<br></br>
				Starting your routine can mean going to the gym and doing a full body routine, two—or even three times a week.  You’ll want to shoot for a routine that will include each of your major muscles. 
				<br></br>
				Include workouts that work muscles including,
				<br></br>
					<ul>
						<li> Your Quads, you can do you lunges, squats, box jumps or even use the stair master. This is a great way to build muscle and endurance at the gym. Just be sure to adjust your workout to your fitness level. </li><br></br>
						<li>Butt and Hamstring workouts can vary, you can do hip raises, dead-lifts, straight leg dead-lifts(those burn) and even step ups.				
						</li><br></br>
						<li>Push movements will work your chest, shoulders and triceps. So, if you're looking to tone up, make sure to include these in your workout. 		
						</li><br></br>
						<li> Core workouts will focus on your abs and lower back, you can do workouts like, planks, jumping knee tucks, side planks and mountain climbers for a great core workout. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				<br></br>
				And don’t forget you can also start of using machines like the elliptical. These machines can help you build cardio and endurance. But if you decide to use these machines, make sure to switch it up, as your body can get used to the gym routine and you’ll notice, you may hit a plateau and this can be very discouraging. 
				<br></br>
				But you can avoid this by mixing up your gym routine and making sure to never do the same routine. It’s okay to do the same workouts but switch it up and make sure you push just enough to start that deep breathing. 
				<br></br>
				It’s a great way to start off the perfect gym routine and the safest way is by going at your own pace and working your way up, don’t worry, pretty soon you’ll be meeting your short-term and long-term goals.  
				<br></br>
				<b>Conclusion</b>
				<br></br>
				Getting started at the gym isn't always easy and sometimes you need a little motivation. But always remember, you are your own motivator, so, get out there and achieve those short-term goals, whatever they may be.  Write them down on a piece of paper and always make sure they are attainable. 
				<br></br>
				Setting goals at the gym doesn't have to feel like it's months away, start with a five pound goal and so forth. You could even start off with smaller goals, including, getting to the gym at least twice a week and making those improvements. 
				<br></br>
				Pretty soon,  you'll be helping others reach their goals and living the life style you always wanted to achieve.
